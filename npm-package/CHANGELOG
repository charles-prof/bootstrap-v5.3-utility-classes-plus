## [unreleased] (Feat 🚀 | Fixed 🐞 | Breaking 🐱)

## [0.1.0] 2024-10-02

### Breaking 🐱

- Remove styling `fs-x` classes, which make no sense to me.

### Fixed 🐞

- Remove `font-monospace` class, whose css variable was not set and therefore, had no effect

## [0.0.3] 2024-07-23

### Fixed 🐞

- `h-x` mapping to `width` instead of `height` css rules.
